/*
 * This file provides an example skeletal stub for the server-side implementation 
 * of a TVML application.
 *
 * A javascript file such as this should be provided at the tvBootURL that is 
 * configured in the AppDelegate of the TVML application. Note that  the various 
 * javascript functions here are referenced by name in the AppDelegate. This skeletal 
 * implementation shows the basic entry points that you will want to handle 
 * application lifecycle events.

/**
 * @description The onLaunch callback is invoked after the application JavaScript 
 * has been parsed into a JavaScript context. The handler is passed an object 
 * that contains options passed in for launch. These options are defined in the
 * swift or objective-c client code. Options can be used to communicate to
 * your JavaScript code that data and as well as state information, like if the 
 * the app is being launched in the background.
 *
 * The location attribute is automatically added to the object and represents 
 * the URL that was used to retrieve the application JavaScript.
